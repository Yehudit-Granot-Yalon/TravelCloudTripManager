# TravelCloudTripManager
In this exercise, I implemented a management system for a service of a travel company, which stores in the 'cloud' information about trips organized by the company. the company
Goes out on a variety of routes, which allow various discount coupons for trips for years. The information is written to a MongoDB database
Each storage service allows the group of CRUD operations consisting of Create, Read, Update, Delete to be performed on the stored object.
